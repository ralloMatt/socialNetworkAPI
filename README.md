# Social Network API
An socail networking app that uses API routes. I also use MongoDB for data. I use express js for routing, a MongoDB database, and mongoose ODM. CRUD operations are used for users and thoughts. Through my routes you can receive / change data on users, thoughts, reactions, and even friends list.

# Installation
 
Make sure to have node js and MongoDB installed. I use Insomia to test my api routes.
